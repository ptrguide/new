# Welcome to PTRGuide!
PTRGuide v2 is in the works now. This update will be a massive change to the way PTRGuide works and looks due to my discovery of CodiMD, which allows me to make PTRGuide look the way I wanted it to look in the beginning.

(Note that not all pages are complete at the moment and there may be some issues.)
